<p class="text_size">The biodiversity of Assam (Assamese: অসমৰ জৈৱবৈচিত্ৰ), a state in North-East India, makes it a biological hotspot with many rare and endemic plant and animal species. The greatest success in recent years has been the conservation of the Indian rhinoceros at the Kaziranga National Park, but a rapid increase in human population in Assam threatens many plants and animals and their natural habitats.</p><br><br>

<h3>Wildlife</h3><hr>
<p class="test_wildlife">With five national parks, two of which are designated World Natural Heritage Sites by UNESCO, and several wildlfe and bird sanctuaries, Assam is a blessed land for wildlife enthusiasts. At the heart of it's mind boggling biodiveristy is the rich topography of Assam with it's lush hills and valleys dissected by the majestic Brahmaputra and it's many tributaries.

  Assam is home to over 180 species of mammals, including rare and endangered species like the great Indian one-horned rhinoceros, the royal Bengal tiger, the golden langur and hoolock gibbon, and a spectacular range of avifauna.
  
  Assam's most famous parks are Kaziranga and Manas. Both were conferred World Heritage Status in 1985.</p><br>
  <h4>Kaziranga National Park</h4>
  
  <p>Kaziranga National Park is spread over 858 sq.kms and is located in the floodplains on both sides of the Brahmaputra river. Patches of mixed deciduous forests are interspersed with vast stretches of savannah grasslands, wetlands and chars of river islands formed by the shifting course of the Brahmaputra.

    The park is divided into five ranges - Central (entry point at Kohora), Western (entry point at Bagori), Eastern (at Agratoli), Western-most Burha Pahar (at Ghorakati) and Northern. The first four lie on the southern side of the river while the last is on the northern bank.
    
    A memorable way of exploring Kaziranga is on eleplant-back as these gentle creatures tread through the tall grass. The park's prized possessions, the rhinos, are usually found in good numbers grazing with deer and buffaloes.
    
    Another option is to see the park is to take the jeep safari which is also highly recommended, as it offers the added benefit of covering a vast expanse in a relatively short span of time.</p><br>

    <p>While on safari, visitors to the park are well advised not only to abide by park etiquettes but also to bear in mind its conservation history, officially counted as the most successful conservation initiative in the sub continent in the 20th century (Kaziranga Centenary: Celebrating the Century's Greatest Success Story, 2005) Originally established as a reserve forest in 1908, Kaziranga was declared a sanctuary in 1916 to counter extensive poaching of the rhinoceros. In 1974, the Indian Government demarcated the present area as a national park. Then, in 2007, it was declared a tiger reserve under the Central Government's Project Tiger scheme.

      The Park is the abode to more than 70% of One Horned Rhinoceros in the world. Highest density of tigers' prey including the large prey biomass of tiger found in the country.</p>
